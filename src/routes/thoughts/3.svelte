		Who should you trust and why? We live in a complex world, full of competing authorities and
		ideas. Many people, both kids and adults, make mistakes when choosing good authorities (myself
		included). They don't always check those authorities against evidence. This article will cover
		who I trust, the difference between peers and authority, and how authority should not be
		unchecked.
	</p>
	<p>
		I trust many different people, and they have different levels of trust. As a Christian, God and
		the Bible have unconditional trust, but not without evidence. I respect my parents very much,
		and they have authority over me, but God has authority over them as he is the ultimate
		authority. Lastly, even though I don't necessarily trust government officals all the time, they
		are an authority in my life and deserve respect. Therefore, I respect them.
	</p>
	<p>
		Other people who are commonly trusted are peers. The problem with giving a significant amount of
		trust to your peers is that most information you get from them is either with barely any
		evidence or is hearsay. Often stuff that I hear from peers (either my parent's peers or my
		peers) comes from a chain of one person telling another person something and so on. If you've
		ever played a game of telephone, you'll know that a chain of people is not a very reliable way
		to convey information. Context is removed, the ideas are reinterpreted, etc. With social media,
		this is even worse, mainly because information can get transformed by a chain of people even
		faster. Lastly, when information comes from a chain of people or posts, it can become impossible
		to find the original source, which means you can't even discover what was originally said.
		Because you can't find the sources, the ideas can be transformed, and it ends up being hearsay,
		peers should not often be trusted unless you go back to the original source.

	<p>
		To clarify, I am not saying that all your friends are untrustworthy. In the previous paragraph,
		I was talking about facts, but we often get advice from our friends, not just facts. If you
		trust your friends to give you sound advice, take it, your friends should be trustworthy in that
		sense, but if your friends are telling you facts, it could be wise to check their sources as
		they are generally not experts on that subject. There is also a gray area between advice and
		facts. For example, if someone bases their advice on facts you find to be untrue, you probably
		shouldn't take their advice. Overall, your peers can be great a giving you advice, but it is a
		good idea to check their sources when they tell you facts.
	</p>
	<p>
		Lastly, all authorities should be fact-checked. Always look for more sources saying the same
		thing, and if you find a source saying a different thing, don't dismiss it, even if it looks
		like it comes from a source you don't agree with, instead determine if they have reasons and if
		the reasons are valid. I believe one way people get sucked into misinformation is by believing
		that their source is trustworthy while also believing that all other sources are wrong without
		even checking their reasons. I, as a Christian, even check the Bible against evidence
		(apologetics), and I don't want to be believing everything I hear blindly. You should check all
		authorities against other authorities and evidence, and you shouldn't ever dismiss opposing
		ideas without thought.
	</p>
	<p>
		In conclusion, I carefully choose who I trust, I don't give much trust to peers, and I check
		authorities against other authorities. You have to trust some people, but you should be careful
		about who you trust. Keep an open mind and don't get stuck staring at only one side of a debate.
