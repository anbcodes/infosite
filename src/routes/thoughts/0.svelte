<p>
	It was December of 2020. I was standing in a new place. Christmas music was playing in the
	background. It was a place I didn’t really want to be. I was uncomfortable and alone. I was
	approached by a stranger, who was soon to become a new friend. He introduced himself to me. He was
	a senior and was into robotics. He seemed nice, and he didn’t appear to be an outgoing person.
	This was the beginning of a new season of change and renewal in my life.
</p>
<p>
	At the end of 2020, I was looking for a change. We had been visiting churches, and we thought that
	we had found one that we liked, but we were not getting connected, and we had reached stagnation.
	In the beginning of December, I tried a new youth group. At the time, I had only a few friends
	outside of the youth group, and I didn’t really know all of them. Determined to make new friends,
	I forced myself to go to a youth group and to try to get connected. The only problem was that I
	was not outgoing and would never go up to someone and introduce myself. So I just stood around and
	did not know what to do. This lasted until a senior pulled me into the youth group. During the
	first month or so, he would come over and talk to me. It gave me a way into the youth group, and
	it was a big reason why I’ve gotten to where I am now.
</p>
<p>
	The first big thing that I did with the youth group was the winter retreat in February. Because of
	Covid, we did not stay overnight, which was actually the only reason I went. I still pretty much
	knew no one and was not interested in staying overnight somewhere with a bunch of strangers.
	Nothing too big ended up happening at the winter retreat, but just being there helped me to become
	part of the youth group even though I barely knew anyone.
</p>
<p>
	From then until August, I continued to go to the youth group, barely missing a week, and life
	groups started up, which were another good way for me to get connected. Sadly the youth group
	stopped during the summer but the life groups continued. As soon as registration for the local
	missions trip opened, I was ready to register, and I’m glad I did. It was the next big thing in my
	growth at the youth group.
</p>
<p>
	The missions trip was big. It was also the farthest out of my comfort zone that I had ever gone.
	During it, all the high school boys stayed overnight at one person's house. I still didn’t really
	know people all that well, and it was a little stressful figuring everything out. It was only
	three days long, but a lot of stuff happened. It was hard work but pretty much the best week ever.
</p>
<p>
	We were each assigned to our own group. For some reason I was placed in the “doing random stuff”
	group. We pretty much just went and did random different things to help. For the first and second
	days, we weeded and spread mulch. On the third day, we helped paint at a private school, and we
	helped a little around the church. On two of the days, I also helped with a Camp of Champions that
	we ran at a housing authority.
</p>
<p>
	On the second night, the end of the week celebration was held at one of the churches participating
	(most of the churches end the missions trip one day early, so we still had another day). It was
	fun and cool to see so many people participating in it together, and celebrating together.
</p>
<p>
	At the end of the local missions trip, everyone said goodbye to the seniors, as they were going
	off to college. They were the leaders and the examples in the youth group. Everyone was really
	really sad to see them go, but multiple younger people in the youth group were ready to step up,
	and in the weeks/months since I have seen many people step up to serve and lead.
</p>
<p>
	After the trip, everything felt like it went back to normal. Also I will note that through most of
	the year, it never felt like much was happening, progress felt slow, and I couldn’t see what was
	changing, or how far I had come. So much had happened though. I had become recognized in the youth
	group, I knew all the high school boys’ names. I played games with them, I had joined the youth
	band, and I had spent a year with the youth group. I barely recognized all this progress until the
	exact one year mark since the first week I had gone to the youth group.
</p>
<p>
	That week reminded me where I used to be, of the changes, and of the progress I had made. On
	Tuesday of that week, we learned that they had reimplemented masks at the youth group, and they
	also moved back into the sanctuary (similar to how it had been when I started youth group). On
	Wednesday, I walked in and just stood in the middle of the room. It felt like I was looking back
	in time, everything looked as it did the first week I had been there, but I had changed.
</p>
<p>
	It was December of 2021. I was standing in a familiar place. Christmas music was playing in the
	background. It was a place I really wanted to be. I was reflecting and thinking, and I approached
	a stranger, who was soon to become a new acquaintance. I introduced myself to him. He was a
	freshman and was into whittling and hunting…
</p>
<p>I had changed. 2021 was a year of renewal of hope and of new beginnings in my life.</p>
